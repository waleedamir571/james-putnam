                The derivation of the equations of theoretical physics began with the introduction of Newton’s f=ma.
                This
                equation mathematically models the empirically established relationship between mass and an object’s
                acceleration. The equation is the beginning of theoretical physics because it introduces mass at the
                earliest
                opportunity before it was understood how to define mass. Physicists did not define mass. The historical
                method of that time is the correct method that should still be used today but isn’t. It is to write an
                equation
                that sets mass equal to a combination of other properties that have been previously introduced by direct
                empirical evidence. The property must be defined at the earliest opportunity.
                <br><br>
                Instead, physicists made a unsubstantiated theoretical decision that mass or force would need to be
                accepted
                as the third indefinable property of physics. Mass was arbitrarily chosen to be indefinable. It was
                accepted
                as
                the third indefinable property of physics. It was joined with the two naturally indefinable properties
                of
                length
                and duration What physicists inaccurately refer to as the property of time. It cannot be the property of
                universal time because we cannot measure universal time. We can measure duration. Length, or distance,
                and
                duration are indefinable because no properties are introduced before them. Physics begins with direct
                empirical measurements of length and duration.
                <br><br>
                We observe that patterns exist in the acceleration of objects. The properties of acceleration are length
                and
                duration. The units of acceleration are a combination of meter and second. That combination is
                (meters/second)/second. Everything we learn about the nature of the universe is learned from direct
                empirical evidence. These are the units of direct empirical evidence. All direct empirical evidence is
                communicated to us in measurements of length and duration. This is the case because charged particles
                located throughout the universe are accelerating. When they accelerate, they send information away from
                themselves in the form of photons, the particle representation of electromagnetism. Charged particles
                located
                elsewhere are hit by this wildly mixed storm of photons arriving from innumerable places, innumerable
                directions, and innumerable times
                <br><br>This article presents the premise that since photons are the principle means by which the
                universe
                communicates with us, that the photon storm is the principal means by which fundamental unity is
                maintained. The universe successfully continues to exist with consistent meaningful operation. Its
                fundamental unity requires that it must have one cause for all effects. What appear to be multiple
                causes in
                the forms of multiple forces must be due to different aspects of a single original cause. This means
                that
                all
                properties that are inferred to exist must be expressible using the same terms as direct empirical
                evidence
                uses. In other words, all property units must be expressible in terms of the units of direct empirical
                evidence.
                For example, the kilogram must be expressible as some combination of meters and seconds.

                The empirical evidence is always about patterns in changes of velocities of objects. Those patterns are
                formed
                from incremental measurements of distance and duration. Duration is measured by comparing a count of a
                selected object’s cyclic activity to the duration of an event. Physicists use the letter t to represent
                this
                count of
                cyclic activity. The unit of the second uses a chosen count as its standard measurement of duration. It
                is
                not a
                measure of time. Time and space are immeasurable. However, physicists refer to the letter t as
                representing
                time.
                No one has ever written an equation that contained the direct representation of the property of time.
                Physicists
                have no experimental basis for telling us anything about physical activities by space or time.

                Theoretical physics no longer recognizes the need to formally define properties using the same
                historical
                method used to define energy and momentum. They do not stress that there is a need to stress a strict
                difference between definable properties and indefinable properties. Definable versus indefinable
                statuses
                establish the order in which properties are introduced so that we learn properly what it is that direct
                empirical evidence is attempting to reveal to us about the nature of the universe. In the past, without
                the
                orderly guidance of direct empirical evidence, physicists’ have misinterpreted properties and used
                arbitrary
                standards of measurement. For example, electric current is used as the standard of measurement for
                electric
                charge. Electric charge is counted but it is the force of electric current that gets measured.

                <br>
                Force is defined in terms of distance, duration, and mass. Its unit of the newton is defined in terms of
                meters,
                seconds, and kilograms. The change that is introduced here is the effect of finally formally defining
                mass.
                Mass is defined in terms of distance and duration only. The unit of the kilogram is defined as a
                combination
                of
                meters and seconds only. The arbitrary assignment of the artifact kilogram as the unit of mass is
                unnecessary.
                The past indefinable status of mass caused the loss of fundamental unity from the derivation of the
                equations
                of theoretical physics. The new defined status of mass immediately restores fundamental unity to f=ma
                and
                the rest of physics that follows.

            <p class="blog-content">
                The equation f/m=a shows that if force and mass are expressed in terms of distance and duration
                only, their units must reduce to those of acceleration. There are a few choices to try, however the
                one that works is for mass to have the units of inverse acceleration. The units of force become a
                ratio of accelerations. Its units can be canceled or even raised to a higher power. This
                fundamentally unified approach to physics theory is next tested by calculating the universal
                gravitational constant and learning its physical basis.

                formally
                defined using the fundamental gravitational constant, then the equation can seem to be defining G with
                an
                expression that ultimately contains G. This is not the case. The reason is that the acceleration due to
                gravity in
                this theory is due to the variation of the one fundamental cause. That cause is not explained here. It
                is
                simply
                inserted into this paper as a given. The properties of that cause are responsible for causing all
                effects.
                Therefore, the phrase, the local acceleration due to gravity, is to be understood as an aspect of that
                cause.
                Read this way, the equation defines G in terms of the fundamental cause

                The activity of the universe is the result of the conservation of acceleration between light and
                objects.
                What
                light loses objects gain and vice versa. This constant exchange is the cause of the effect that we call
                gravity.
                Freely falling objects gain speed because photons flying toward the Earth are decreasing their speed.
                There
                is
                a need for physicists to discover that this Principle of Conservation of Acceleration waits to be
                recognized.

                That mass could have been and should have been formally defined using the historical method used to
                define
                energy and momentum.

                Theoretical physics is an interpretation of the operation of a Universe that lacks fundamental unity.
                <br><br>
                There is no direct empirical evidence to support the existence of either time-dilation or
                space-contraction.
                <br><br>
                There is a great need for physics to return to its original condition of being the science of
                measurements.
                <br><br>
                That a new system of units is necessary to further investigate physics with fundamental unity restored.
                <br><br>
                There is just one cause for the operation of the universe.
