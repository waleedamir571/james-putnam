        <p class="blog-content">
            The derivation of the equations of theoretical physics began with the introduction of Newton’s f=ma. This
            equation mathematically models the empirically established relationship between mass and an object’s
            acceleration. The equation is the beginning of theoretical physics because it introduces mass at the
            earliest
            opportunity before it was understood how to define mass. Physicists did not define mass. The historical
            method of that time is the correct method that should still be used today but isn’t. It is to write an
            equation
            that sets mass equal to a combination of other properties that have been previously introduced by direct
            empirical evidence. The property must be defined at the earliest opportunity.
            <br><br>
            Instead, physicists made a unsubstantiated theoretical decision that mass or force would need to be accepted
            as the third indefinable property of physics. Mass was arbitrarily chosen to be indefinable. It was accepted
            as
            the third indefinable property of physics. It was joined with the two naturally indefinable properties of
            length
            and duration What physicists inaccurately refer to as the property of time. It cannot be the property of
            universal time because we cannot measure universal time. We can measure duration. Length, or distance, and
            duration are indefinable because no properties are introduced before them. Physics begins with direct
            empirical measurements of length and duration.
            <br><br>
            We observe that patterns exist in the acceleration of objects. The properties of acceleration are length and
            duration. The units of acceleration are a combination of meter and second. That combination is
            (meters/second)/second. Everything we learn about the nature of the universe is learned from direct
            empirical evidence. These are the units of direct empirical evidence. All direct empirical evidence is
            communicated to us in measurements of length and duration. This is the case because charged particles
            located throughout the universe are accelerating. When they accelerate, they send information away from
            themselves in the form of photons, the particle representation of electromagnetism. Charged particles
            located
            elsewhere are hit by this wildly mixed storm of photons arriving from innumerable places, innumerable
            directions, and innumerable times
            <br><br>This article presents the premise that since photons are the principle means by which the universe
            communicates with us, that the photon storm is the principal means by which fundamental unity is
            maintained. The universe successfully continues to exist with consistent meaningful operation. Its
            fundamental unity requires that it must have one cause for all effects. What appear to be multiple causes in
            the forms of multiple forces must be due to different aspects of a single original cause. This means that
            all
            properties that are inferred to exist must be expressible using the same terms as direct empirical evidence
            uses. In other words, all property units must be expressible in terms of the units of direct empirical
            evidence.
            For example, the kilogram must be expressible as some combination of meters and seconds.

            The empirical evidence is always about patterns in changes of velocities of objects. Those patterns are formed
            from incremental measurements of distance and duration. Duration is measured by comparing a count of a
            selected object’s cyclic activity to the duration of an event. Physicists use the letter t to represent this count of
            cyclic activity. The unit of the second uses a chosen count as its standard measurement of duration. It is not a
            measure of time. Time and space are immeasurable. However, physicists refer to the letter t as representing time.
            No one has ever written an equation that contained the direct representation of the property of time. Physicists
            have no experimental basis for telling us anything about physical activities by space or time.

        <p class="blog-content">
            Theoretical physics no longer recognizes the need to formally define properties using the same historical
            method used to define energy and momentum. They do not stress that there is a need to stress a strict
            difference between definable properties and indefinable properties. Definable versus indefinable statuses
            establish the order in which properties are introduced so that we learn properly what it is that direct
            empirical evidence is attempting to reveal to us about the nature of the universe. In the past, without the
            orderly guidance of direct empirical evidence, physicists’ have misinterpreted properties and used arbitrary
            standards of measurement. For example, electric current is used as the standard of measurement for electric
            charge. Electric charge is counted but it is the force of electric current that gets measured. 

            <br>
            Force is defined in terms of distance, duration, and mass. Its unit of the newton is defined in terms of meters,
            seconds, and kilograms. The change that is introduced here is the effect of finally formally defining mass.
            Mass is defined in terms of distance and duration only. The unit of the kilogram is defined as a combination of
            meters and seconds only. The arbitrary assignment of the artifact kilogram as the unit of mass is unnecessary.
            The past indefinable status of mass caused the loss of fundamental unity from the derivation of the equations
            of theoretical physics. The new defined status of mass immediately restores fundamental unity to f=ma and
            the rest of physics that follows.

        <p class="blog-content">
            The equation f/m=a shows that if force and mass are expressed in terms of distance and duration
            only, their units must reduce to those of acceleration. There are a few choices to try, however the
            one that works is for mass to have the units of inverse acceleration. The units of force become a
            ratio of accelerations. Its units can be canceled or even raised to a higher power. This
            fundamentally unified approach to physics theory is next tested by calculating the universal
            gravitational constant and learning its physical basis.

        Newton's formula for the force of gravity contains the universal gravitational constant G. The question
answered here is: What physical phenomenon does G represent? The answer can be gained from a close
inspection of the force formula. Newton's formula for the force of gravity contains expressions for two
separate masses:

            There is an important clue in this difference between the formulas. There is a break in unity between these two
            formulas that should not persist. This point can be demonstrated by altering the second formula:

            What I will show is that one is theoretically derivable from the other. Two new clues are available to help decipher
            this riddle of the force of gravity. One clue is that the normal units for the universal gravitational constant
            converted to empirical units are:

            Empirical newtons represent unity. Kilograms are replaced by the units of inverse acceleration. The units of G
            are velocity to the 4thpower. The second clue is that force is dimensionless. The new theoretical tool which
            this makes available is that a single force can be the product or quotient of any number of other forces. The
            units still match because there are no units. 
            <br>
            The new units of the universal gravitational constant are those of velocity to the fourth power. Inserting
these new units into the force of gravity formula allows one to move easily between the different fundamental
forms of a force equation. First it is recognized that an incremental change in velocity has units of velocity.
Incremental values of change of a property will be preceded by the symbol ∆. Units of velocity to the 4th
power allow me to anticipate that:

            This suggests that Newton's basic formula for the force of gravity can consist of the product of two other
measures of force. I will shortly give a physical interpretation for these two forces. For now, I will develop
further mathematical representation for the force of gravity. Acceleration can be expressed as:

            What is this acceleration that helps to form the value of G? I can reasonably anticipate that our macroscopic
concept of gravity is formed from quantum values of a primary value of gravitational force. What I mean is:
Two particles of matter, neutrons, would experience a fundamentally important measure of gravity at a
distance equal to the radius of the hydrogen atom. To test this hypothesis, I solve for the acceleration, as a
remote stationary observer, contained in G. Since I am thinking in terms of two identical particles, their
accelerations are equal and I can write:

            This magnitude of force is the square root of the magnitude of force obtained using Newton's formula. The
units of Newton's formula make this into a real dilemma. However, recognizing that in this example force has
no units removes this dilemma. One force can be the square root of another force. What can be the physical
interpretation of the product of two forces? 
<br><br>
The answer to this question comes from recognizing that there are two ways to measure the acceleration of
the two neutrons. A remote stationary observer would measure each neutron as having equal accelerations
with respect to the observer. A local observer located at one of the neutrons would measure an acceleration
of one proton with respect to the other neutron. The local observer's measure of acceleration would be
different from that obtained by the stationary observer.
<br><br>
The path of the theoretical connection between the two is to use force. For the stationary observer there is a
different value of force with which to work. He uses a value of force that will predict a neutron’s acceleration
with respect to him. This is not the same value of force that must be used to measure the acceleration of one
proton with respect to the other proton. For the local observer located on one of the neutrons:

            I now use as a guide the formula derived above which shows Newton’s force of gravity to be the product of
            two other forces. In other words, I assume the value of the remotely measured force to be the square of the
            locally measured force. The mathematical expression of this is:

            The interpretation for this result is: The fundamental gravitational constant is the square of the local acceleration
            due to gravity, for a local observer, of one neutron toward another neutron multiplied by the square of the
            distance between them. The distance is the length of the radius of the hydrogen atom. 
            <br><br>
            There is an appearance of an artificial aspect of this result. Since the acceleration due to gravity is formally
defined using the fundamental gravitational constant, then the equation can seem to be defining G with an
expression that ultimately contains G. This is not the case. The reason is that the acceleration due to gravity in
this theory is due to the variation of the one fundamental cause. That cause is not explained here. It is simply
inserted into this paper as a given. The properties of that cause are responsible for causing all effects.
Therefore, the phrase, the local acceleration due to gravity, is to be understood as an aspect of that cause.
Read this way, the equation defines G in terms of the fundamental cause

            The activity of the universe is the result of the conservation of acceleration between light and objects. What
            light loses objects gain and vice versa. This constant exchange is the cause of the effect that we call gravity.
            Freely falling objects gain speed because photons flying toward the Earth are decreasing their speed. There is
            a need for physicists to discover that this Principle of Conservation of Acceleration waits to be recognized.

            That mass could have been and should have been formally defined using the historical method used to define
energy and momentum.

Theoretical physics is an interpretation of the operation of a Universe that lacks fundamental unity.
<br><br>
There is no direct empirical evidence to support the existence of either time-dilation or space-contraction. 
<br><br>
There is a great need for physics to return to its original condition of being the science of measurements. 
<br><br>
That a new system of units is necessary to further investigate physics with fundamental unity restored. 
<br><br>
There is just one cause for the operation of the universe.
