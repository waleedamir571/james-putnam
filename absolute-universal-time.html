            Unity is the foundation of the design of the universe. This article shows how physicists can overcome the
            detrimental effects on modern physics of mistakenly removing fundamental unity from the early basics upon
            which our understanding of the nature of the universe must be built. Unity must be restored. It requires
            there to be one primary source of control over the various types of action that are currently explained as
            resulting due to individual forces. When particles of matter are observed to experience changes in speed or
            direction physicists look for causes. The sources of the causes are always found to be other particles of
            matter. Matter is believed to contain special ingredients, such as electric charge, that radiate force
            fields. This
            resort to a division of cause is not what unity requires. There can be only one primary cause for all
            physics
            effects. That cause keeps our universe operating in its continuous orderly manner with all parts
            contributing
            to keep the universe in existence. We learn about the universe by means of photons. They deliver our
            information from the outside world. Photons are activated by acceleration of objects. They end their action
            by
            causing other objects to accelerate. There is an ongoing trade of acceleration between light and objects.

            Electric charge is credited with being the source of light. However, those two mysterious unknowns that
            showed up in Coulomb’s electric force equation, represented by the letters q, weren’t learned what they are
            by having direct empirical evidence provide a formal definition of electric charge. They were guessed to be
            the source of light. Their equation positions were like the positions of the masses in newton’s
            gravitational
            force equation. However, these two equations appear to offer us two different fundamental causes in a
            universe that can have only one.

        <p class="blog-content">
            Mass is easy to define. It should have been defined when f=ma was introduced. It was made known to us by
            how direct empirical evidence introduces it as the first property that could be defined. Electric charge is
            more
            mysterious. We aren’t guided by direct empirical evidence toward learning what electric charge is. It is
            very
            important. We can surmise this by recognizing that its magnitude is a universal constant. Mass does not have
            this honor. There is the separate Universal Gravitational Constant, but the author has elsewhere shown that
            that constant has a physical origin. It is not a given, i.e., a gift of knowledge from the Universe that is
            not
            derivable.

            <br>
            Therefore, our first challenge is to learn what electric charge is. Is it just a number without connection
            to
            anything we experience here on the Earth? Or is it so common and so base we do not suspect it. We will learn
            in this article what electric charge is. The formula for electric force is:

            The letter q represents electric charge. I will use the hydrogen atom to analyze electric charge. The
            letters qq
            represent the electric charge of an electron and a proton. These values are empirically determined to be of
            the
            same magnitude but to have opposite signs. The empirical magnitude of q is:

            This value is a fundamental universal constant, and it must appear as such in this new theory. We must look
            for this number, in the MKS system of units, to show up on its own as the equations of physics are derived.
            The source of information I am using is the hydrogen atom. When working with the hydrogen atom, I noticed
            that the time it takes for light to travel its radius is approximately the magnitude of electric charge. I
            represent the velocity of light by the expression:

            The magnitude of the increment of time in the denominator on the right side is this measure of time. The
            numerator is approximately the size of the hydrogen radius. The numerator divided by the denominator is
            approximately the speed of light. I found this period appearing elsewhere in solutions. I will apply it to
            some
            physics derivations here and show that it is so useful that it unifies physics equations and makes new
            equations possible

            The existence of electric charge is a theoretical assumption. The electromagnetic effects make it seem like
            it’s
            real. It is a physics property, but it defies being formally defined. It is from their formal definitions
            that we
            learn what each property is. Is electric charge not a force? Is it possible that it is a measure of time? I
            will
            substitute this measure of time in place of electric charge. If the change of unit from coulomb to the
            second is
            wrong, this mixing of units will not match, and the results will be nonsense. That does not happen. Polarity
            will be addressed later.

            We are not actually deriving an equation; we are forming it. We will replace electric charge with that
            measure
            of time having the same magnitude and change the unit from coulomb to the second. If this step proves to be
            a correction to the interpretation of electric charge, then a crucial block to achieving a unified theory
            will have
            been removed. It will have been discovered that there is no such thing as electric charge. The example will
            deal with electromagnetic effects of the hydrogen atom. We make the substitution. For atomic dimensions, it

            This answer is close to the frequency of the electron that is orbiting in the first energy level of the

            angle in radians
            moved by the electron during the time required for light to travel the radius of the hydrogen atom. The
            distance around the hydrogen atom circumference that the electron travels for the time it takes for
            light to
            travel the radius of the hydrogen atom divided by the radius of the 1st energy level yields a ratio of
            lengths.
            Divide each of those two lengths by the amount of time it takes for light to travel the radius of the

            necessary to properly use this increment of time in the differential equations that make up the

            Electromagnetic radiation is a phenomenon physics associates with particles of light called photons.
            However, the particles of charged matter are the sources for all electromagnetic photons. The properties of
            the charged particles, in general, give rise to the properties of the emitted photons. Therefore,
            mathematics
            describing the properties of photons should be translatable into expressions using the properties of the
            charged particles that emitted them.

            change of velocity. The rate of change of velocity can be measured with respect to either time or distance.
            Two very useful higher-level properties are energy and momentum. These two properties are complex forms

            convenience in comparing mathematical expressions from electromagnetic field theory with analogous
            expressions from this theory, I will take the liberty of using differential instead of incremental
            expressions in

            Since photons are themselves incremental and not so small as to be defined by differential values, this

            that, for
            macroscopic purposes, using this approach loses nothing of significance. The benefit gained will be clarity

            The work of Maxwell has been interpreted to prove the existence and the uniting of a varying electric field
            and a varying magnetic field. He produced equations that are credited with fundamentally defining
            electromagnetic radiation effects. I will now derive analogous equations from this new theory

            The equations I will derive are not just symbolic substitutes adding nothing to Maxwell's discoveries. The
            very first step in this derivation goes to the heart of separating the results of this theory from
            electromagnetic
            field theory. The electric field is defined as:

            I will use this equation as it applies to a force caused by a single charged particle. Since I am seeking to

            This says the speed of sound is the rate of change of the electric field with respect to the magnetic field.
            In
            electromagnetic field theory, there is nothing moving at the speed of sound. What then is the origin of this
            relationship between the speed of sound and electromagnetic radiation? Since electromagnetic radiation
            14
            consists of discrete photons that are carrying increments of acceleration given to them by an accelerating
            particle, then I can look back to the emitting particle for an answer.
            <br> <br>
            I have derived for this theory analogous expressions for both the electric field and magnetic field of
            electromagnetic theory. I will use these to trace the speed of sound back to the emitting particle. The
            definition of the electric field of a single photon is:

        </p>

        <p class="blog-content">
            And this theory's definition of the magnetic field of a single photon is:

            I substitute these two expressions into the formula for the speed of sound:

            So, the photon's increment of electric field divided by its increment of magnetic field is equal to the rate of
change of the kinetic energy of the emitting particle with respect to the rate of change of the momentum of
the particle. Furthermore, they are both equal to the speed of sound:

            = 𝑣
        </div>
        <br>
        <p class="blog-content">
            I want to extend the meaning of this formula directly to the emitting particle. It is known an incremental
            change of kinetic energy of the particle is given by:


        </p>
        <div class="text-center blog-content">
            𝑑𝐸𝑝 = 𝑚𝑒𝑣𝑝𝑑𝑣

        <p class="blog-content">
            And an incremental change of momentum of the particle is given by:



        </p>
        <div class="text-center blog-content">
            𝑑𝑃𝑝 = 𝑚𝑒𝑑𝑣𝑝

        <br>
        <p class="blog-content">
            I have already shown the rate of change of the kinetic energy with respect to the rate of change of the
momentum is equal to the speed of sound. Therefore, I can write:

            This says the free electrons in a metal, those producing electromagnetic radiation, move at the speed of
            sound. For an electron in space vp may be a variable, but not for an electron roaming relatively free inside a
            metal. For example, electrons inside an antenna are suggested to be roaming randomly around at the speed of
            sound.
            15
            When a potential is applied to the antenna, some of these electrons are impacted by incoming energetic
            photons. The electrons accelerate in an organized manner by the same average incremental amount. When
            they are accelerated, they cause other photons to carry away their incremental change in velocity. This
            explanation is a simplified interpretation I offer to suffice for now.

            To support this idea as applying to at least the solid materials in general, I will use the speed of sound in glass

            This equation suggests the existence of a relationship between the speed of sound and a single atom. This
            possibility is not pursued in this article. There is however an immediate use for this formula. It shows force is
            dimensionless. The units of velocity cancel each other out. This possibility has been pursued and utilized in

            It is argued that it has been shown to a creditable degree that the magnitude previously used as electric
            charge is a universal constant period of absolute, universal time. It is claimed that this period is the single
            most unifying item when used in the denominator of rates of change of events. It is to be used in place of the
            derivative of duration in physics equations making calculations on the scale of the hydrogen atom. In those
            cases, the letters dt represent a constant incremental measure of absolute, universal time supplied to us by
            the universe
